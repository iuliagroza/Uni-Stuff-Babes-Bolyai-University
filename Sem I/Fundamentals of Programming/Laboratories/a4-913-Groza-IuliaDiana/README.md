## Problem Statements
### 1. Numerical List
A math teacher needs a program to help students test different properties of complex numbers, provided in the `a+bi` form (we assume `a` and `b` are integers for simplicity). Write a program that implements the functionalities exemplified below:

**(A) Add a number**\
`add <number>`\
`insert <number> at <position>`\
e.g.\
`add 4+2i` ‚Äì appends `4+2i` to the list\
`insert 1+1i at 1` ‚Äì insert number `1+i` at position `1` in the list (positions are numbered starting from `0`)

**(B) Modify numbers**\
`remove <position>`\
`remove <start position> to <end position>`\
`replace <old number> with <new number>`\
e.g.\
`remove 1` ‚Äì removes the number at position `1`\
`remove 1 to 3` ‚Äì removes the numbers at positions `1`,`2`, and `3`\
`replace 1+3i with 5-3i` ‚Äì replaces all occurrences of number `1+3i` with the number `5-3i`

**(C) Display numbers having different properties**\
`list`\
`list real <start position> to <end position>`\
`list modulo [ < | = | > ] <number>`\
e.g.\
`list` ‚Äì display all numbers\
`list real 1 to 5` ‚Äì display the real numbers (imaginary part `=0`) between positions `1` and `5`\
`list modulo < 10` ‚Äì display all numbers with modulo `<10`\
`list modulo = 5` ‚Äì display all numbers with modulo `=5`

**(D) Obtain different characteristics of sub-lists**\
`sum <start position> to <end position>`\
`product <start position> to <end position>`\
e.g.\
`sum 1 to 5` ‚Äì display the sum of the numbers between positions `1` and `5`\
`product 1 to 5` - display the product of numbers between positions `1` and `5`

**(E) Filter the list**\
`filter real`\
`filter modulo [ < | = | > ] <number>`\
e.g.\
`filter real` ‚Äì keep only numbers having imaginary part `=0`\
`filter modulo < 10` ‚Äì keep only numbers having modulo `<10`\
`filter modulo > 6` ‚Äì keep only those numbers having modulo `>6`

**(F) Undo**\
`undo` ‚Äì the last operation that modified program data is reversed. The user can undo all operations performed since program start by repeatedly calling this function.

### 2. Contest
During a programming contest, each contestant had to solve 3 problems (named `P1`, `P2` and `P3`). Afterwards, an evaluation committee graded the solutions to each of the problems using integers between `0` and `10`. The committee needs a program that will allow managing the list of scores and establishing the winners. Write a program that implements the functionalities exemplified below:

**(A) Add the result of a new participant**\
`add <P1 score> <P2 score> <P3 score>`\
`insert <P1 score> <P2 score> <P3 score> at <position>`\
e.g.\
`add 3 8 10` ‚Äì add a new participant with scores `3`,`8` and `10` (scores for `P1`, `P2`, `P3` respectively)\
`insert 10 10 9 at 5` ‚Äì insert scores `10`, `10` and `9` at position `5` in the list (positions numbered from `0`)

**(B) Modify scores**\
`remove <position>`\
`remove <start position> to <end position>`\
`replace <old score> <P1 | P2 | P3> with <new score>`\
e.g.\
`remove 1` ‚Äì set the scores of the participant at position `1` to `0`\
`remove 1 to 3` ‚Äì set the scores of participants at positions `1`, `2` and `3` to `0`\
`replace 4 P2 with 5` ‚Äì replace the score obtained by participant `4` at `P2` with `5`

**(C) Display participants whose score has different properties.**\

`list sorted`\
`list [ < | = | > ] <score>`\
e.g.\
`list` ‚Äì display participants and all their scores\
`list < 4` ‚Äì display participants with an average score `<4`\
`list = 6` ‚Äì display participants with an average score `=6`\
`list sorted` ‚Äì display participants sorted in decreasing order of average score

**(D) Obtain different characteristics of participants**\
`avg <start position> to <end position>`\
`min <start position> to <end position>`\
e.g.\
`avg 1 to 5` ‚Äì display the average of the average scores for participants between positions 1 and 5\
`min 2 to 7` - display the lowest average score of the participants between positions 2 and 7

**(E) Establish the podium**\
`top <number>`\
`top <number> <P1 | P2 | P3>`\
`remove [ < | = | > ] <score>`\
e.g.\
`top 3` ‚Äì display the 3 participants having the highest average score, in descending order of average score\
`top 4 P3` ‚Äì display the 4 participants who obtained the highest score for P3, sorted descending by that score\
`remove < 70` ‚Äì set the scores of participants having an average score `<70` to `0`\
`remove > 89` ‚Äì set the scores of participants having an average score `>89` to `0`

**(F) Undo**\
`undo` ‚Äì the last operation that modified program data is reversed. The user can undo all operations performed since program start by repeatedly calling this function.
