# ðŸ’» Assignment 06 - 08
## Requirements
- You will solve one of the problems below using simple feature-driven development
- Your program must provide a menu-driven console-based user interface. Implementation details are up to you
- Implementation must employ layered architecture and classes

### For week 8 (25% of grade)
- Implement features 1 and 2
- Have at least 20 procedurally generated items in your application at startup
- Provide specification and tests for all non-UI classes and methods for the first functionality
- Implement and use your own exception classes.

### For week 9 (25% of grade)
- Implement features 3 and 4
- Implement **PyUnit test cases**

### For week 10 (50% of grade)
- All features must be implemented

## Bonus possibility (0.1p, deadline week 10)
- 95% unit test code coverage for all modules except the UI (use *PyCharm Professional*, the *[coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.3/)* or other modules)

## Bonus possibility (0.2p, deadline week 10)
- Implement a graphical user interface, in addition to the required menu-driven UI. Program can be started with either UI, without changing the source code.

## Problem Statements
### 1. Students Register Management
A faculty stores information about:
- **Student**: `student_id`, `name`
- **Discipline**: `discipline_id`, `name`
- **Grade**: `discipline_id`, `student_id`, `grade_value`

Create an application to:
1. Manage students and disciplines. The user can add, remove, update, and list both students and disciplines.
2. Grade students at a given discipline. Any student may receive one or several grades at any discipline. Deleting a student also removes their grades. Deleting a discipline deletes all grades at that discipline for all students.
3. Search for disciplines/students based on ID or name/title. The search must work using case-insensitive, partial string matching, and must return all matching disciplines/students.
4. Create statistics:
    - All students failing at one or more disciplines (students having an average <5 for a discipline are failing it)
    - Students with the best school situation, sorted in descending order of their aggregated average (the average between their average grades per discipline)
    - All disciplines at which there is at least one grade, sorted in descending order of the average grade(s) received by all students
5. Unlimited undo/redo functionality. Each step will undo/redo the previous operation performed by the user. Undo/redo operations must cascade and have a memory-efficient implementation (no superfluous list copying)

### 2. Student Lab Assignment
Write an application that manages student lab assignments for a discipline. The application will store:
- **Student**: `student_id`, `name`, `group`
- **Assignment**: `assignment_id`, `description`, `deadline`
- **Grade**: `assignment_id`, `student_id`, `grade_value`

Create an application that allows to:
1. Manage students and assignments. The user can add, remove, update, and list both students and assignments.
2. Give assignments to a student or a group of students. In case an assignment is given to a group of students, every student in the group will receive it. In case there are students who were previously given that assignment, it will not be assigned again.
3. Grade student for a given assignment. When grading, the program must allow the user to select the assignment that is graded, from the studentâ€™s list of ungraded assignments. A studentâ€™s grade for a given assignment cannot be changed. Deleting a student removes their assignments. Deleting an assignment also removes all grades at that assignment.
4. Create statistics:
    - All students who received a given assignment, ordered descending by grade.
    - All students who are late in handing in at least one assignment. These are all the students who have an ungraded assignment for which the deadline has passed.
    - Students with the best school situation, sorted in descending order of the average grade received for all graded assignments.
5. Unlimited undo/redo functionality. Each step will undo/redo the previous operation performed by the user. Undo/redo operations must cascade and have a memory-efficient implementation (no superfluous list copying)

### 3. Movie Rental
Write an application for movie rentals. The application will store:
- **Movie**: `movie_id`, `title`, `description`, `genre`
- **Client**: `client_id`, `name`
- **Rental**: `rental_id`, `movie_id`, `client_id`, `rented_date`, `due_date`, `returned_date`

Create an application which allows to:
1. Manage clients and movies. The user can add, remove, update, and list both clients and movies.
2. Rent or return a movie. A client can rent a movie until a given date, as long as they have no rented movies that passed their due date for return. A client can return a rented movie at any time.
3. Search for clients or movies using any one of their fields (e.g. movies can be searched for using id, title, description or genre). The search must work using case-insensitive, partial string matching, and must return all matching items.
4. Create statistics:
    - Most rented movies. This will provide the list of movies, sorted in descending order of the number of days they were rented.
    - Most active clients. This will provide the list of clients, sorted in descending order of the number of movie rental days they have (e.g. having 2 rented movies for 3 days each counts as 2 x 3 = 6 days).
    - Late rentals. All the movies that are currently rented, for which the due date for return has passed, sorted in descending order of the number of days of delay.
5. Unlimited undo/redo functionality. Each step will undo/redo the previous operation performed by the user. Undo/redo operations must cascade and have a memory-efficient implementation (no superfluous list copying).

### 4. Library
Write an application for a book library. The application will store:
- **Book**: `book_id`, `title`, `author`
- **Client**: `client_id`, `name`
- **Rental**: `rental_id`, `book_id`, `client_id`, `rented_date`, `returned_date`

Create an application to:
1. Manage clients and books. The user can add, remove, update, and list both clients and books.
2. Rent or return a book. A client can rent an available book. A client can return a rented book at any time. Only available books (those which are not currently rented) can be rented.
3. Search for clients or books using any one of their fields (e.g. books can be searched for using id, title or author). The search must work using case-insensitive, partial string matching, and must return all matching items.
4. Create statistics:
    - Most rented books. This will provide the list of books, sorted in descending order of the number of times they were rented.
    - Most active clients. This will provide the list of clients, sorted in descending order of the number of book rental days they have (e.g. having 2 rented books for 3 days each counts as 2 x 3 = 6 days).
    - Most rented author. This provides the list of book authors, sorted in descending order of the number of rentals their books have.
5. Unlimited undo/redo functionality. Each step will undo/redo the previous operation performed by the user. Undo/redo operations must cascade and have a memory-efficient implementation (no superfluous list copying).

### 5. Activity Planner
The following information is stored in a personal activity planner:
- **Person**: `person_id`, `name`, `phone_number`
- **Activity**: `activity_id`, `person_id` - list, `date`, `time`, `description`

Create an application to:
1. Manage persons and activities. The user can add, remove, update, and list both persons and activities.
2. Add/remove activities. Each activity can be performed together with one or several other persons, who are already in the userâ€™s planner. Activities must not overlap (user cannot have more than one activity at a given time).
3. Search for persons or activities. Persons can be searched for using name or phone number. Activities can be searched for using date/time or description. The search must work using case-insensitive, partial string matching, and must return all matching items.
4. Create statistics:
    - Activities for a given date. List the activities for a given date, in the order of their start time.
    - Busiest days. This will provide the list of upcoming dates with activities, sorted in ascending order of the free time in that day (all intervals with no activities).
    - Activities with a given person. List all upcoming activities to which a given person will participate.
5. Unlimited undo/redo functionality. Each step will undo/redo the previous operation performed by the user. Undo/redo operations must cascade and have a memory-efficient implementation (no superfluous list copying).
