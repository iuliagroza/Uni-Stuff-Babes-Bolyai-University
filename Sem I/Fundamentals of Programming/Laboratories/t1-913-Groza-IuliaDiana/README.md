# ðŸŽ² Code runners
Implement a console-based version of the code runner game, in which the human must determine the value of a pseudo-random number generated by the computer. The game works in the following way:
1. When a new game is started, the computer generates a four digit random secret number; the first digit is non-zero and all digits are distinct (e.g. `1234`, `1984`, `1980`, `1024` are okay; `3435`, `2001`, `0123`, `8888` are not okay) **[1.5p]**
2. The game is played over a number of rounds. Each round is played in the following way:\
  **(a)** The human player enters a four digit number; if the number is not a valid guess (see rules from 1.), the game is over and the computer wins **[1.5p]**\
  **(b)** The computer informs the player about the number of codes and the number of runners. Codes are correct digits in the correct position, runners are correct digits but in incorrect positions **[2p]**
		
    **e.g.** let's say the computer selected the secret number `5873`; let's analyze what the computer reports for a few player guesses:\
  `9624` -> computer reports 0 codes and 0 runners (none of the digits are in `5873`)\
  `1234` -> computer reports 0 codes and 1 runner (3 is a runner, but the computer does not report which digits are codes/runners, only their numbers)\
  `3257` -> computer reports 0 codes and 3 runners (3, 5 and 7 are runners)\
  `3875` -> computer reports 2 codes and 2 runners (8,7 are codes and 3,5 are runners)\
  **(c)** `8086` is a cheat code that when entered as a guess, causes the computer to reveal the number it selected (the game otherwise continues as usual) **[1p]**
3. The game ends after being played for more than 60 seconds, as measured in real-time **[1p]**, or when the player guesses the correct number **[1p]**. In either case, display a corresponding message.

**[1p]** Specification for the function that generates the random secret number.

## Observations
- Functionalities where the implementation is not divided into a user interface and functions that communicate via parameters and return values are graded at 50%
- To work with time, examine Python's [datetime module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
